## **Graduate Admission Prediction**

**A deep learning project using Keras to predict graduate program admission likelihood based on various factors.**

### **Objective**
**Predict admission chances using a regression model built with Keras.**

### **Dataset**
**Features include GRE, TOEFL, university rating, SOP, LOR, GPA, and research experience.**

### **Methodology**
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, normalize data, and encode categorical variables.
- **Model Development**: Build a regression model with multiple hidden layers using ReLU and a linear output layer.
- **Training**: Train the model with the Adam optimizer and minimize mean squared error.
- **Evaluation**: Assess performance using metrics like MAE and R-squared.
- **Prediction**: Predict admission likelihood for new data.

### **Expected Outcome**
**An accurate regression model to predict graduate admission chances and provide actionable insights.**
